# Electricity Consumption Forecasting

This is a time series forecasting project for electricity consumption using XGBoost.

## Description

The goal of this project is to predict future electricity consumption based on historical consumption data. The model utilizes temporal and trend features to make accurate predictions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vagner-sr/Energy_consumption_time_series_prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. Run the Jupyter notebook `Energy_Consumption_Prediction.ipynb` to train the model and make predictions.

2. Explore the source code to understand the data preprocessing methods, model training, and prediction.

3. To visualize the model predictions, execute the cells in the Jupyter notebook or analyze the generated plots.

## Project Structure

- `Energy_Consumption_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the project code.
- `data/`: Folder containing the electricity consumption data.
- `model.json`: File of the trained model.
